                The common interest that members of the Association share is to
                inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
                to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
                background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <ol class="olPrincipal">
              <li>
                <span>DIMENSIONS.</span> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible
                external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum
                width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all
                fields used by teams under 12 and older.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within the
                competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
                districts or associations participating in the state competition
                program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board
                which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may
                be required to play all their games away.
              </li>

                    penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be
                    progressively larger.
                  </li>
                  <li>
